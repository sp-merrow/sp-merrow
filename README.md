- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sp-merrow
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, music, and DIY handyman projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Information Technology at George Mason University
- Currently I'm working on learning more Python, and this is where I'm going to post project files I've written so I can document and share my progress.
- As I learn other languages, frameworks, etc. I'll also post projects from those as well.
